## Posterior Sampling for RL on Graphs 
This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments proposed in "Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning on Graphs" published in TMLR.

## Organisation

The code is organised as follow: 
- the folder envs contains the code related to the max-flow environment as well as the floris environment.
- agent.py contains the implementation of all the learning algorithms (PSRL and PSGRL).
- the notebooks are used to run experiments.
